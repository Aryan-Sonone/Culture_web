                    <b>1. About Punjab</b>
                    <br>
                    Punjab, meaning "the land of five rivers," is a region in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, split between India and Pakistan after the Partition in 1947. The Indian state of Punjab is known for its fertile plains, primarily used for agriculture, making it the "Granary of India." The main rivers flowing through the region are Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum (now in Pakistan). Chandigarh is the capital of the Indian Punjab.

The people of Punjab, known as Punjabis, are primarily divided into Sikhs and Hindus in India, with a significant Muslim population in the Pakistani Punjab. The official language is Punjabi, written in the Gurmukhi script in India and Shahmukhi in Pakistan.

<b>2. Festivals of Punjab</b>
Punjabi culture is vibrant and rich in festivals, many of which are centered around agriculture, religious traditions, and the changing seasons.

<br><b>Baisakhi</b>:<br> One of the most important festivals, Baisakhi marks the Punjabi New Year and the harvest of the Rabi crop. For Sikhs, it also commemorates the formation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699.
<br><b>Lohri</b>: Celebrated in January, Lohri is a harvest festival marking the end of winter. Bonfires are lit, and people gather around to sing and dance to Punjabi folk songs.
<br><b>Gurpurabs</b>: These are celebrations of the birth anniversaries of Sikh Gurus, especially Guru Nanak (founder of Sikhism) and Guru Gobind Singh.
<br><b>Diwali</b>: Though celebrated all over India, Diwali holds special significance in Punjab, especially in Amritsar, where the Golden Temple is illuminated beautifully.
<br><b>Maghi</b>: Celebrated in January, Maghi marks the martyrdom of the Forty Immortals who fought for Guru Gobind Singh.
</p>
<p> <b>Mythology of Punjab</b>
<br><b>Punjab’s mythology</b> is deeply influenced by Hinduism and Sikhism, with a rich tapestry of ancient and medieval stories from both traditions.

<br><b>Mythology:</b> The region has a strong connection to various Hindu epics. For example, the city of Amritsar was once called Ramdaspur, named after Guru Ram Das, but is also connected to the Ramayana.
<br><b>Sikhism:</b> Sikh mythology revolves around the lives and teachings of the ten Sikh Gurus. Guru Nanak’s hymns, called "Gurbani," are not just religious texts but also mythological narratives that express deep spiritual meanings. The creation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh is a key event in Sikh history, treated with mythic reverence.

<p>4. Folklore of Punjab
Punjabi folklore is rich in heroic tales, love legends, and ballads that reflect the culture’s bravery, passion, and simplicity. Some of the most well-known Punjabi folklore includes:

Heer Ranjha: A tragic love story that is perhaps the most famous of all Punjabi folk tales. Heer, a beautiful girl from a wealthy family, falls in love with Ranjha, a wandering musician. Their love faces societal opposition, leading to a heartbreaking end. Waris Shah's poetic rendition is the most famous.
Sohni Mahiwal: Another tragic love story of a potter’s daughter, Sohni, who falls in love with Mahiwal, a cattle herder. Their secret meetings across the river Indus become legend, with Sohni ultimately drowning while trying to meet her lover.
Mirza Sahiban: A ballad of love and betrayal, where Sahiban elopes with Mirza, a great archer. However, in a twist of fate, Sahiban breaks his arrows to prevent bloodshed, leading to their tragic end.
Puran Bhagat: A tale of devotion and renunciation. Puran, a prince wronged by his family, becomes a spiritual figure after years of penance.
Punjabi folk music, including Boliyan, Tappe, and Gidha, accompanies these stories, usually performed at weddings and festivals.

5. Connections to Mahabharata
Punjab is an important region in the Mahabharata, the great Indian epic.

Kurukshetra: The Mahabharata's final battle, the Kurukshetra war, took place in what is now Haryana, very close to modern Punjab. Kurukshetra remains a pilgrimage site for Hindus to this day.
Gandhara and Shakuni: The kingdom of Gandhara, located in present-day Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region (near Punjab), was the homeland of Shakuni, the maternal uncle of the Kauravas. Shakuni played a pivotal role in the events that led to the Kurukshetra war.
Indraprastha: While not directly in Punjab, the Pandavas ruled from Indraprastha (modern-day Delhi), which is geographically close to the Punjab region. Punjab would have been part of their kingdom.
Jalandhara: Some scholars believe that the city of Jalandhar in Punjab is named after a demon king, Jalandhara, mentioned in the Puranas, although not directly related to the Mahabharata.
